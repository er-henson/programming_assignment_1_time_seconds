Algorithm Design – Time Passed in Seconds 

Problem: finding the total number of seconds that have passed after a given number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds 

	Print purpose of program
	
    Take day input 

    Convert day input to int 

    Take hour input 

    Convert hour input to int 

    Take minute input 

    Convert minute input to int 

    Take input for seconds 

    Convert second input to int 

    Multiply day input by number of seconds in a day (60*60*24) 

    Multiply hour input by number of seconds in an hour (60*60) 

    Multiply minute input by number of seconds in a minute (60) 

    Add all inputs together, including second input without changing it 

    Print final total of all inputs added together 

•Example input: 

3 days 

4 hours 

24 minutes 

8 seconds 

•Example output: 

275048 seconds total have passed 

Also accounts for “uneven” input of time units (for example, putting in 0 hours and 72 minutes instead of 1 hour and 12 minutes. Both will return 4320 seconds)
